# Exercise 2

**Requirement 1.** Add a new command to the calculator named "history". When the user runs the "history" command display a history of the commands in the console.

**Requirement 2.** Add a new command to the calculator named "remove". When the user runs the "remove" command, ask the user for a history entry id. Then remove the history entry from the history list. Do not update the result.

**Requirement 3.** When the "clear" command is executed, clear the history.

**Requirement 4.** Remove the global result variable.

**Requirement 5.** Assuming the order of the history is the operation order.

**Requirement 6.** Write a function which calculates the result using the history. The function should have no print statements in it. Call the function from the appropriate place within the structure of your code.

**Requirement 7.** Refactor repetitive code into functions.

**Requirement 8.** Create a new folder named `calc_app`. Move the `calc_app.py` file to the new folder and rename the file to `__main__.py`. Organize the functions into multiple modules and import them into `__main__.py` as appropriate. Run the calc app as module using the command `python -m calc_app`.

**Requirement 9.** You are free to update your code to use additional syntaxes and other Python features not covered yet, except for classes.
