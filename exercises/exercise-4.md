# Exercise 4

**Requirement 1.** Implement two new commands into Calc App: `load` and `save`

**Requirement 2.** The `load` command loads a file named `history.json` into the history object. If the file does not exist, do not throw an error, just set the history entry list to blank.

**Requirement 3.** The `save` command saves the list of history entries to a file named `history.json`. The save command should replace any existing history file.

**Requirement 4.** Use the `with open` syntax for loading and saving the file.

**Requirement 5.** Think about code organization as you implement the solution.
